NextJS, tailwind, firebase,TypeScript

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is production ready React framework. And It provides features like hybrid static & server rendering,smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) provides utility first css classes which increases the speed of development.
- Reason behind choosing behind choosing [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is that it is very easy to use and provides all the functionalities that was needed for the project from `authentication`, `realtime database` to `cloud storage`. Moreover, It is for free.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) >>> Javascript!! I want to get used to using typescript as It helps us avoid bugs and enforces types which is really a need for medium sized project.
